          Mercury
          <p>
            Mercury can refer to the planet, the chemical element, or the Roman
            messenger god. The planet Mercury is the smallest and innermost
            planet of our solar system, a rocky, airless world with extreme
            temperature swings and a heavily cratered surface. The chemical
            element Mercury is a heavy, silvery-white metallic liquid at room
            temperature, known for its toxicity and historical use in
            thermometers.

          Venus
          <p>
            Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is a rocky world with a
            thick, toxic atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with
            clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the hottest planet in our solar
            system due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Its surface is marked by
            vast plains, highland regions, and numerous volcanoes, some of which
            may still be active. Venus has a slow rotation period, taking about
            243 Earth days to complete one rotation, and it rotates in the
            opposite direction to most planets in the solar system.

          <p>
            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and our home, a rocky world
            with a dynamic surface of land and water, known for being the only
            known planet to support life due to its unique atmosphere, liquid
            water, and stable temperatures. The planet has a solid inner core, a
            liquid outer core, and a flowing mantle that drives tectonic plates,
            creating mountains and valleys on its surface.

          Mars
          <p>
            Mars, known as the "Red Planet" for its iron-rich rust-colored
            surface, is the fourth planet from the Sun. It's a cold, desert
            world with a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere, polar ice caps,
            volcanoes, and large canyons, including Olympus Mons, the solar
            system's largest volcano. Mars has weak gravity, seasons, and
            features like dust devils and global dust storms.

          Jupiter
          <p>
            Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System and the fifth from
            the Sun, a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It's
            known for its distinctive colorful bands, powerful storms like the
            enduring Great Red Spot, and a massive magnetic field. Despite its
            enormous size—more than twice the mass of all other planets
            combined—Jupiter is thought to have a small rocky core deep within
            its gaseous layers

          Saturn
          <p>
            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is known for its
            stunning rings, which are made up of ice and rock particles. It is a
            gas giant with a thick atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen and
            helium. Saturn has a low density, meaning it could float in water if
            a large enough body of water existed. The planet has at least 82
            moons, with Titan being the largest and one of the most Earth-like
            bodies in the solar system.

          Uranus
          <p>
            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and has a unique
            blue-green color due to methane in its atmosphere. It is an ice
            giant with a composition mainly of hydrogen, helium, and ices like
            water, ammonia, and methane. Uranus has a distinct tilt of about 98
            degrees, causing extreme seasonal variations. It has a faint ring
            system and at least 27 known moons. The planet's atmosphere features
            strong winds and storms, making it an intriguing subject for study
            in our solar system.

          Neptune
          <p>
            Neptune is the eighth and furthest known planet from the Sun, a
            dark, cold, and windy ice giant with a vibrant blue color due to
            methane in its atmosphere. It's the most massive of the ice giants,
            composed of a hot, dense fluid of water, ammonia, and methane
            surrounding a rocky core, but has no solid surface. Known for its
            supersonic winds, Neptune is the windiest planet in the solar system
            and is so far from the Sun that high noon there would seem like dim
            twilight.
